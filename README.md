# Quantum Support Vector Machines
The [paper](QSVM_Project.pdf) with its accompanying [jupter notebook](QSVM_Project.ipynb) provide an empirical comparison of kernel driven algorithms and their quantum counterparts: classical support vector machines (SVM), quantum support vector machines (QSVM) and quantum support vector classifiers (QSVC).
