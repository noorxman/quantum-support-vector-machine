# Quantum Support Vector Machines
The paper with its accompanying jupter notebook provide an empirical comparison of kernel driven algorithms and their quantum counterparts: classical support vector machines (SVM), quantum support vector machines (QSVM) and quantum support vector classifiers (QSVC).
